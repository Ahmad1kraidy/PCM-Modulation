This project contains a Simulink model that demonstrates the simulation of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).

üìÑ Description:
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. This Simulink model shows the key stages of PCM, including:

Analog signal generation

Sampling

Quantization

Binary encoding

The simulation is visual and ideal for understanding how analog signals are converted into digital bitstreams using PCM.

üìÅ File:
pcm_model.slx: The Simulink file containing the complete PCM system.

‚úÖ Requirements:
MATLAB & Simulink R20xx or later (replace with your version, e.g., R2022a)

No additional toolboxes required

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run:
Open MATLAB.

Navigate to the project folder.

Open the model:

matlab

open_system('pcm_model.slx')
Click Run to simulate.
